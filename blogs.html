<p class="aboutp">A blog page is a web page that displays a series of blog posts, typically in reverse chronological order (with the most recent post appearing first). Blog pages are a common feature of websites that host blogs, which are online platforms where individuals or organizations can publish regular entries of content, such as articles, essays, or personal stories. Blog pages may also include features such as archives, categories, and tags, which help readers navigate and find specific content on the blog. Overall, blog pages are a great way for bloggers to share their ideas and perspectives with a wider audience and engage with their readers through comments and other forms of feedback.It is a frequently updated web page used for personal commentary or business content. Blogs are often interactive and include sections at the bottom of individual blog posts where readers can leave comments.
    Think of pages as your static content or “one-off” kind of content that will seldom need changing. This might for example be your About page and is seen as a timeless entity. Posts on the other hand are your blog entries or dynamic content that gets added regularly.
